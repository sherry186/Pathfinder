# Pathfinder, shed light on your exploring path

### Description
Pathfinder is the app to inspire and help students discover their passion. Targeted for Taiwanese high school students facing the 2019 New Curriculum Guidelines, it offers an innovative solution to guide them through the process of building their Academic Portfolio. With Natural Language Inference technology, Pathfinder analyzes studentâ€™s core competencies from their records, proactively recommends majors that require those competencies. Furthermore, Pathfinder recommends career-related activities based on their candidate majors, enabling students to explore and learn spontaneously on their own. Students can be motivated through the mechanism, but not only comply to the regulated educational system in Taiwan.
